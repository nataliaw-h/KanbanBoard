# Kanban Board Project

## Description

This is a highly configurable, multi-language (Polish and English) Kanban Board project built with React, and backed by Firebase. The project provides a highly customizable experience where users can create their own projects. Within each project, the number and names of columns are user-defined, offering a level of personalization to better suit individual needs.

Tasks from all user projects are not only arranged in their respective Kanban boards but are also displayed in a calendar and in notifications. This ensures that no task is overlooked and users are always up to date with their schedules.

A unique feature is the colour-coding of tasks. Depending on the time remaining until the task deadline, tasks are displayed in different colors. This visual representation aids users in easily identifying urgent and upcoming tasks, thereby promoting efficient time management.
